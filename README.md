## Run with Docker
Docker Compose is really useful when we donâ€™t have the development environment setup on our local machine to run all parts of the application to test.
To run the application use :
### `docker-compose up`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
